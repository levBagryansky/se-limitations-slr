## Has the study raised any issues of Symbolic Execution?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning issues/difficulties/challenges/etc. of 
Symbolic Execution.
  
5. (Yes/No): `No`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 5.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

## Has the study introduced any new technique within Symbolic Execution field?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning any technique/approach/method related to Symbolic Execution.
  
6. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 6.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

6.1 `p. 1,Our symbolic cache model can verify whether the sensitive data leakage due to speculative execution can be observed by an attacker at a given program point.`  
6.2 `p. 1, In this paper, we extend symbolic execution with the modeling of speculative execution as well as cache accesses`  
6.3 `p. 2, We model the behavior of the cache by capturing memory accesses to concrete or symbolic memory addresses; the symbolic memory accesses occur when the accessed memory address depends on a symbolic input such as accessing array element a[i] when i is a symbolic input variable`
6.4 `p. 2, We present KLEESPECTRE , our methodology to extend state-of-the-art symbolic execution engines with micro-architectural features, specifically speculative execution and caches (Section 4).`

## Has the study suggested any formal or informal proof of the limitations mentioned?

Please examine Abstract, Introduction and Contribution sections on the subject of mentioning any description or references to
formal or empirical proof justifying any of Symbolic Execution problems.
  
7. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 7.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

7.1 `p. 1, This is because the reasoning in current day symbolic execution engines is solely at the program level.`
