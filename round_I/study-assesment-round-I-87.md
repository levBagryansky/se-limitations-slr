# STUDY ASSESSMENT - ROUND I

Please replace '???' (triple question mark) in form below with respective answers.
Note that this round doesn't assume deep dive into all datails of the paper materials.
All the answers are supposed to be found within Abstract and Introduction sections if present.
Otherwise in other sections in skimming mode.

## Has the study raised any issues of Symbolic Execution?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning issues/difficulties/challenges/etc. of Symbolic Execution.

5. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 5.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnecessary items)

5.1 `p.1 Experimental results show that symbolic execution is
highly scalable using parallel algorithms: using 512 processors,
more than two orders of magnitude speedup are observed.`  
5.2 `p.5 ParSym: Parallel Symbolic Execution`
5.3 `p.5 We believe these optimizations will allow symbolic
execution to scale to many more problems and its impact on
testing real software will increase.`

## Has the study introduced any new technique within Symbolic Execution field?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning any technique/approach/method related to Symbolic Execution.

6. (Yes/No): `Yes`

If you answered 'Yes' please provide below references to the location(s) within the study supporting your answer:  
(add as many list items 6.x as required in format `page No., citation`. Remove unnessesary items)

6.1 `p.1 The main problem in parallelizing symbolic execution is to avoid transport of
these structures between parallel nodes. Concrete inputs, on the other hand, are usually
small and can be further compressed by using input domains (pre-decided sets of
values). We divide work such that each.`  
6.2 `p.2 Our parallel symbolic execution algorithm is based on
combined symbolic and concrete execution [23], [10]. We
start by executing the program on an initial input...`

## Has the study suggested any formal or informal proof of the limitations mentioned?

Please examine the paper on the subject of mentioning any description or references to
formal or empirical proof justifying any of Symbolic Execution problems.

7. (Yes/No): `No`
